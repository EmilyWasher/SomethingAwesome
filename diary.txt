So I'm starting this diary a bit late, I have already done some work. I wrote a
C code to encode a Caesar cipher today. Currently reads in from STDIN and prints
to STDOUT. I am looking to change this so eventually I have a web application. 
Will also work on decoding a Caesar cipher. Researched the different types of 
ciphers

Made a working version of the Atbash cipher (reverse cipher). As it's premise is reversing the alphabet, the encrypting code is the same as the decrypting code. Also got a version of the substitution encrypting cipher working. It currently creates two arrays, a scrambled lower case and upper case alphabet and is based on the C rand() function and is seeded off the time. I also copied and modified the Caesar cipher code to create a program that can decipher text when given a key.
