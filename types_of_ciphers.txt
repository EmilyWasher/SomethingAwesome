Caesar Cipher:
    Also known as the shift cipher and is a type of substitution cipher. 
    The user picks a key between 1 and 26 (although 26 is pointless) and the 
    input message is shift across by that number.

Atbash Cipher
    Substitution Cipher in which the alphabet is reversed
   
Substituion Ciphers
    The alphabet is scrambled, shifted or reversed so each letter corresponds to
    a new letter in the substitution alphabet. When encoding each letter in the 
    plain text message is replaced with a letter from the substitution alphabet.
    Traditionally, punctuation was omitted to disguise word boundaries and avoid 
    errors. The plain text can substituted as single letters, pairs of letters,
    etc.

Transposition Cipher
    The letters in the plain text aren't changed but rather reordered in some 
    way. For example, the message can be reversed.

Vigenere Cipher
    A series of Caesar ciphers are used to encrypt the message
